**TESCREAL** is an acronym labelling a belief system that crosses over traditional and contemporary transhumanist-aligned ideas.^[[The Wide Angle: Understanding TESCREAL — the Weird Ideologies Behind Silicon Valley’s Rightward Turn](https://washingtonspectator.org/understanding-tescreal-silicon-valleys-rightward-turn/)] It was coined in 2023 by transhumanist critic [[Pages/Émile Torres|Émile Torres]] and AI bias researcher [[Pages/Timnit Gebru|Timnit Gebru]]^[[https://twitter.com/xriskology/status/1635313845400113153]]^[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timnit_Gebru]]^[[The Acronym Behind Our Wildest AI Dreams and Nightmares](https://www.truthdig.com/articles/the-acronym-behind-our-wildest-ai-dreams-and-nightmares/)] and used as a pejorative framing Silicon Valley elite [[Pages/techno-utopianism|techno-utopianism]].^[[Conspiracy Theories, Left Futurism, and the Attack on TESCREAL](https://medium.com/institute-for-ethics-and-emerging-technologies/conspiracy-theories-left-futurism-and-the-attack-on-tescreal-456972fe02aa)] [[Pages/James Hughes|James Hughes]] and [[Pages/Eli Sennesh|Eli Sennesh]] have written about how the idea of a "TESCREAL" as a coherent set of ideologies makes little sense and Gebru and Torres' analysis of the "TESCREAL bundle" amounts to a left-wing conspiracy theory.^[[Conspiracy Theories, Left Futurism, and the Attack on TESCREAL](https://medium.com/institute-for-ethics-and-emerging-technologies/conspiracy-theories-left-futurism-and-the-attack-on-tescreal-456972fe02aa)] "TESCREALism" has been further criticized by M. Adelstein at Bentham's Newsletter.^[[Against TESCREALISM](https://benthams.substack.com/p/against-tescrealism)]
