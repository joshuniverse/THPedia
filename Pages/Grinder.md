**Grinders** are people who apply the hacker ethic to improve their own biological bodies with do-it-yourself cybernetic devices and self-mutations. Many grinders identify with the [[Pages/biopunk|biopunk]] movement (also rarely admitted with cyberculture/cyberpunk movement as well and sometimes with postcyberpunk or cypherpunk movements), [[Pages/open source|open source]] [[Pages/transhumanism|transhumanism]], and [[Pages/technoprogressivism|technoprogressivism]].

## Origins
In role-playing games, 'grinding' is the practice of engaging in repetitive tasks to improve a character. The 2007 comic series *[[Pages/Doktor Sleepless|Doktor Sleepless]]* by [[Pages/Warren Ellis|Warren Ellis]] compared this to the progression of DIY transhumanism.^[[Unfinished Apocalypse: Doktor Sleepless](http://sequart.org/magazine/39426/unfinished-apocalypse-doktor-sleepless/)]

## Biohacking
A biohacker is a [[Pages/biopunk|biopunk]] hobbyist who experiments with DNA and other aspects of [[Pages/genetics|genetics]].^[[Playing God in Your Basement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1988/01/31/playing-god-in-your-basement/618f174d-fc11-47b3-a8db-fae1b8340c67/)]^[[Biohacking 101: Tools of the Biopunk Trade](http://genomealberta.ca/blogs/biohacking-101-tools-of-the-biopunk-trade.aspx)] A biohacker (or "wetware hacker") is similar to a computer hacker who creates and modifies software or computer hardware as a hobby, but should not be confused with a bioterrorist, whose sole intent is the deliberate release of viruses, bacteria, or other germs used to cause illness or death in people, animals, or plants (in the same way a computer hacker should not be confused with the more popular, yet erroneous, use of the term, describing someone who spreads computer viruses or breaks into computer systems for malicious purposes).^[[Roses Are Black, Violets Are Green: The Emergence of Amateur Genetic Engineers](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12516984-100-forum-roses-are-black-violets-are-green-the-emergence-of-amateur-genetic-engineers/)]

Pat Mooney, executive director of ETC Group, is a critic of biohacking who argues that—using a laptop computer, published gene sequence information, and mail-order synthetic DNA—just about anyone has the potential to construct genes or entire genomes from scratch (including those of lethal pathogens) in the near future. He warns that the danger of this development is not just bio-terror, but "bio-error."^[[Synthetic Biology Report](http://openwetware.org/images/e/e4/Synbioreportweb.pdf)]
