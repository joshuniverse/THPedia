**Opposition to human genetic engineering** is a position of opposing or [[Pages/Technoconservatism|questioning]] certain biotechnological developments towards [[Pages/genetic engineering|genetic engineering]] in humans.

Some of the opposition is so strong that a [[Pages/Proposed international ban on human genetic engineering|global ban]] has been proposed, but ultimately did not pass; however, a discussion about regulatory frameworks was recommended.^<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-gene-editing-ban-20151203-story.html International gene editing conference declines to ban eventual use in humans]</ref>
