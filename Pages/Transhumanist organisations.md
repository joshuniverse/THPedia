**Transhumanist organisations** are many and varied and collectively influence much of the [[Pages/transhumanist community|transhumanist community]] as a whole.

## Introduction
Transhumanism has many related [[Pages/Comparison of futurist related ideas and positions|disciplines]] and [[Pages/Transhumanist synonyms and closely related terms|terms]], so much so that few organisations need primarily self-identify as a 'transhumanist organisation'. However, when one examines a number of key fields, one can often identify the largest concentrations of transhumanists, self-identified, [[Pages/de facto transhumanist|de facto]] and otherwise having similar organisational relationships.

## Private Sector

### Biotech
*Main: [[Pages/Longevity industry|Longevity industry]]*

Biomedical research organisations like [[Pages/SENS|SENS]] and [[Pages/Calico|Calico]] are high-profile advocates of [[Pages/life extension|life extension]]. However, many more mainstream organisations are pushing back the frontiers of medical research in the field of [[Pages/gerontology|gerontology]], neurology, and many more.

### Information Technology
Businesses, often those associated with [[Pages/Silicon Valley|Silicon Valley]] or the technology sector, may embrace futurist ideas of their founders, such as [[Pages/digital immortality|digital immortality]] in development from [[Pages/Facebook|Facebook]], however, such affiliations are usually kept to a low profile.

Transhumanist and futurist ideas are integral to [[Pages/Silicon Valley|Silicon Valley]] culture and to the wider IT sector in general.^[[Citation Needed](#)]

### Cryonics
[[Pages/Cryonics|Cryonics]] has long had a close relationship as a part of the transhumanism movement and as its own entity, with many advocates seeing it as a 'Plan B' for life extension and self-preservation.

### Artificial Intelligence
[[Pages/AI|AI]] research, a cousin of both transhumanism and futurism, is undergoing tremendous growth in interest. [[Pages/MIRI|MIRI]], founded by transhumanist [[Pages/Eliezer Yudkowsky|Eliezer Yudkowsky]] and [[Pages/OpenCog|OpenCog]] from [[Pages/Ben Goertzel|Ben Goertzel]] are both highly futurist projects in the AI space, with the conversation, especially around [[Pages/AI risk|AI risk]] entering mainstream political debate.

### Supplements
Many supplement companies such as the [[Pages/Life Extension Foundation|Life Extension Foundation]] directly market their products for life extensionists.

## Advocacy

### Life Extension Advocacy
[[Categories/Life extensionist organisations|Life extension advocacy]] organisation is a huge growth area, with proponents such as the [[Pages/Coalition for Radical Life Extension|Coalition for Radical Life Extension]] and [[Pages/LEAF|LEAF]] bringing together a large group of scientists and supporters behind the cause of [[Pages/radical life extension|radical life extension]]. Many smaller grassroots initiatives exist in this space such as the [[Pages/Eternal Life Fan Club|Eternal Life Fan Club]] and media such as [[Pages/Life Mag|Life Mag]].

### Politics
The surge in [[Pages/transhumanist politics|transhumanist politics]], primarily driven by [[Pages/Zoltan Istvan|Zoltan Istvan]]'s 2016 presidential campaign, has led to the formation of many new [[Pages/transhumanist party|transhumanist party]] organisations, but also by previous initiatives such as the [[Pages/Longevity Party|Longevity Party]] and [[Pages/Evolution 2045|Evolution 2045]].

## Community

### Offline Communities
Offline, transhumanists tend to be associated with the technology sector and sometimes [[Pages/transhumanist art|the arts]], often with associations with respective online communities. Many events will be based around [[Pages/meetup|meetups]].

### Biohackers, Body Modders, and Nootropic Users
[[Pages/Biohacking|Biohacking]], sometimes known as 'DIY transhumanism', has a growing following through sites like [[Pages/Biohack.me|Biohack.me]], with its spectrum flowing into traditional body modification. Responsible community-led drug research organisations such as the [[Pages/Psychonaut Wiki|Psychonaut Wiki]] and [[Pages/Erowid|Erowid]] aim to support people expanding their consciousness and capabilities in a responsible and safe way.

## Art and Media

[[Pages/Transhumanist art|Transhumanist art]] is most often found in [[Pages/cyberpunk|cyberpunk]] or [[Pages/science fiction|science fiction]] media such as [[Pages/video games|video games]] and books, many of which command significant followings. From the soft sci-fi of [[Pages/Star Trek|Star Trek]] through to the cybernetic future of [[Pages/Deus Ex|Deus Ex]], millions of fans worldwide may find their first exposure to transhumanist ideas and discussions.

Many prominent [[Pages/transhumanist writer|science fiction authors]] are transhumanists or have been the first to express certain transhumanist ideas.

## Public Sector

### Academia
Within academia, professional [[Pages/Futurist|futurists]] may engage in [[Pages/future studies|future studies]] or other cross-disciplinary research touching on transhumanist ideas. [[Pages/Singularity University|Singularity University]] was one of the first overtly futurist organisations to focus on these areas, though many established institutions may have established futurist-related functions often related to their science disciplines.

### Government
Within a government context, transhumanism is possibly most associated with [[Pages/DARPA|DARPA]], the US military advanced research projects division. Many governments have 'futurist' departments such as the UK government's [[Pages/Foresight projects|Foresight projects]] division, with topics such as AI and longevity making their way into serious political discussion.

## Dedicated Organisations

### Transhumanist and Futurist Organisations
Transhumanist organisations are often synonymous or closely related with [[Pages/futurism|futurist]] organisations, such as [[Pages/London Futurists|London Futurists]], the [[Pages/Future of Humanity Institute|Future of Humanity Institute]], whereas a smaller amount are overtly transhumanist such as the [[Pages/IEET|IEET]] and of course [[Pages/Humanity+|Humanity+]]. Many futurist publications such as [[Pages/futurism.com|futurism.com]], [[Pages/Singularity Hub|Singularity Hub]], or even the [[Pages/Turing Church|Turing Church]] put out regular original content, commentary, and analysis of technological trends.

Within this space, small [[Pages/spiritual transhumanism|spiritualistic]] and [[Pages/religious transhumanism|religious]] organisations can be found.

### Online Communities and Media
Finally, the grassroots transhumanist community has formed many nexuses of discussion, largely on [[Pages/Facebook|Facebook]], but also on other [[Pages/transhumanist discussion forums|transhumanist discussion forums]] such as [[Pages/Less Wrong|Less Wrong]] and [[Pages/LongeCity|LongeCity]], often mixing a wide variety of [[Pages/techno-optimism|techno-optimistic]] ideas coupled with socialisation and participating in a small amount of activism. Modern [[Pages/chat|chat]] networks are increasingly popular.

Bloggers, [[Pages/YouTube|YouTubers]], and increasingly dedicated [[Pages/transhumanist news resources|transhumanist news resources]] offer ongoing sources of analysis and commentary.
