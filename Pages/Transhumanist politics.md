**Transhumanism** in a political sense is historically tied to many ideas concerning liberty, self-ownership, and freedoms. These ideas are located in most political platforms, but the most prominent in the early 1990s were libertarian ideas on the one hand and liberal Green ideas on the other. However, the socio-economic efforts about human rights and freedoms of the [[Pages/Extropy Institute|Extropy Institute]] founded in California, at a time in the late 80's and 90's where government adoption of radical sciences seemed unthinkable, and involvement to be cautious.

By the mid-2000s, influential figures such as [[Pages/Leon Kass|Leon Kass]] grew to prominence as [[Pages/bioconservatism|bioconservatives]], prompting the disdain of centrist and leftist transhumanists such as [[Pages/James Hughes|James Hughes]].

[[Pages/Zoltan Istvan|Zoltan Istvan]]'s 2014 campaign for President, although not on the ballot and more of a media-based promotion, brought about what became the [[Pages/Transhumanist Party (US political organization)|Transhumanist Party]] that caused a grassroots mobilization of politically interested transhumanists from various political positions to develop often more liberal, considered practical political positions.

## History

### Natasha Vita-More
Transhumanist involvement in politics can be traced back to 1992 when [[Pages/Natasha Vita-More|Natasha Vita-More]], under her previous name *Nancie Clark*, was elected to the County Council of the Green Party of Los Angeles County, representing the 28th State Senate district.^[[County Council, Green Party of Los Angeles County](http://losangeles.cagreens.org/county-council)] She ran with a platform of transhumanist technologies to solve environmental issues, as promoted by the television show *Transhuman UPdate TV*, which aired in the Los Angeles area from 1988 onwards. Natasha is the first and remains the only transhumanist elected to office and was elected with the most votes.^[[Election History](http://www.cagreens.org/lacounty/cc/election_history_92_00.html)] She resigned her seat in 1993.

In 2019, Natasha collaborated with [[Pages/Gabriel Rothblatt|Gabriel Rothblatt]] in authoring the [[Pages/Transhumanist Political Action Committee|Transhumanist Political Action Committee]].

### Extopianism
*Main [[Pages/Extropianism|Extropianism]]*

From the 1990s through to the mid-2000s, the Extropy Institute (ExI) advocated for the transhumanist philosophy and worldview. The term "extropianism" is a type of transhumanism based on the Principles of Extropy. ExI did not promote any one political view and its members held diverse political stances. However, the democratic approach of ExI embraced political views that support the goals of transhumanism. While many members sought a libertarian approach that endorsed human rights and personal liberty [[Pages/libertarian transhumanism|libertarian transhumanism]], other political ideas were held and first used in conjunction with transhumanism.

### Gabriel Rothblatt
In July 2014, [[Pages/Gabriel Rothblatt|Gabriel Rothblatt]] was described as ^[[very possibly the first openly transhumanist political candidate in the United States](http://hplusmagazine.com/2014/07/01/interview-gabriel-rothblatt-congressional-candidate-in-floridas-8th-district/)] by [[Pages/H+ Magazine|H+ Magazine]] editor [[Pages/Peter Rothman|Peter Rothman]]. Rothblatt was running as the Democrat party congressional candidate in Florida’s 8th District. Rothblatt made the following points in the H+ Magazine interview:

<blockquote>
Every movement begins as a fringe, successful movements eventually grow to become dominant trends, and that entails having a political voice. Especially in America there is a great divide growing between science and politics, a divide that in a time of enormous technological growth, itself poses an existential risk for humanity. We cannot continue to let government ignore and fail to respond to the rapidly changing technological world around us. Transhumanism must gain mainstream acceptance, or lose out to the idiocracy of luddites with thermonuclear capabilities.

In the early 90s we saw some of the first movements towards the acceptance of ‘queers.’ Now twenty years later we are seeing a tsunami of supportive legislation. Same in the 50s and 60s with civil rights, the 10s and 20s with suffrage. Transhumanism is the next battleground for civil rights, and it needs leaders to do more than pontificate in chatrooms and internet comments.

Transhumanism, like feminism, is more than just a single issue; it’s a philosophy and relates to many issues. Consumer protections, veterans, healthcare, property rights, civil rights, surveillance and sousveillance, the 2nd amendment, personhood, immigration, disabilities… technology and multiculturalism have changed how we interact with everything, in my opinion transhumanism is a path to understanding these relationships...

My personal identification and experiences as a transhumanist have certainly informed my worldview...

My platform is predominantly about making education a solution and not an industry. My campaign does seek to educate people about the realities of the present and the choices of the future. It is my intention that through this campaign many people will take a closer more serious look at what transhumanism is and how they may already be, unknowingly well in its grasps...

I’m an extremely passionate advocate for space, which is very much the essence of and a major driver for transhumanism. I also have a great amount of empathy for our veterans returning from wars and the difficulties of living with the realities and stigma of being ‘disabled.’ These issues highlight the already widespread, and long history of transhumanism. It’s now finally a time that we can connect the dots and begin pushing for public acceptance and equality for those already living as transhumanists and those who may choose to become one.

The issue of choice and more centrally, liberty, is something transhumanist I intend to push for. Specifically, I believe we may need an addition to our Bill of Rights to ensure our liberty in an exponentially technologically world. That is, what I would describe as the Freedom of Form, a right to exist and to transform into whatever extant reality possible. This would protect future beings who would choose to make adaptations to their body in an effort to enhance their appearance, enjoyment or safety. It would maintain rights and protections for beings in stasis or virtual perpetuity.
</blockquote>

### The Transhumanist Party
Since the October 2014 start of [[Pages/Zoltan Istvan|Zoltan Istvan]]'s high-profile campaign with his [[Pages/Transhumanist Party (US political organization)|Transhumanist Party]] political organization, many transhumanists have sought to develop existing transhumanist principles in directions where they can be more directly applied to short and medium-term policy initiatives.

### Transhuman National Committee of the United States
The [[Pages/Transhuman National Committee|Transhuman National Committee]] (TNC) was initially organized by [[Pages/David Kelley|David J Kelley]] in an effort to redirect political discord around transhumanism and politics and create a community-driven effort focused on organizing as a 527 PAC in the United States to move a transhumanist lobby effort to affect policy in the United States. The organization held a virtual convention in Feb 2016 where it adopted its charter rules and initial policy platform to which it moved into additional funding and organizational efforts post the convention. See [Transhuman Politics Wiki](http://wiki.TranshumanPolitics.com/).

### Politicisation controversy
This new direction has [[Pages/Transhumanist politicisation controversy|sometimes been controversial]] within the community, and the definition of what are and are not transhumanist political positions is still an ongoing conversation.

## Transhumanist political projects
Political initiatives that have significant support within at least parts of the transhumanist community include:

* [[Pages/Universal basic income|Universal basic income]]
* [[Pages/Genomic choice|Genomic choice]]
