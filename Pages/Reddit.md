**Reddit** is a very large social media platform comprised of many general and specialist 'subreddits', aka subforums, on a great many topics. There are many large transhumanist and futurist subreddits. It is likely the largest collection of transhumanist discussion areas outside of [[Pages/Facebook|Facebook]].
