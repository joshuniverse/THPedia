# Oligarchic Transhumanism

**Oligarchic** or **plutocratic** transhumanism is a popular portrayal of enhancement technologies in science fiction and a major concern of more left-leaning futurists/transhumanists. The idea is highly popular in [[Pages/biopunk|biopunk]] and [[Pages/cyberpunk|cyberpunk]] genres.

## As a futurist concern
The extent to which this scenario must be avoided is a differentiator between [[Pages/Libertarian transhumanism|libertarian transhumanists]], for whom it is of concern, and [[Pages/Social futurism|social futurists]]/[[Pages/Democratic transhumanism|democratic transhumanists]], for whom it is a more significant concern.

Modern headlines tell stories of the super-rich 'buying [[Pages/immortality|immortality]]', creating a distrust of such technologies.^[Survival of the richest: how London's super-rich are trying to buy immortality](http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/esmagazine/survival-of-the-richest-how-londons-superrich-are-trying-to-buy-immortality-a3118071.html)^[DNA testing, £24,000-a-week retreats and FREEZING their heads: TV show reveals the bizarre ways the rich try to defy death (but some methods are called 'utter nonsense')](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3371681/Channel-4-reveals-bizarre-ways-rich-try-defy-death.html)

Concerns are often expressed about the potential for [[Pages/social statis|social statis]] around matters such as gender, race, religious conflict, class, and other hierarchical inequalities that could significantly slow or cease development in a world where the elite rarely die.^[Deku-shrub - Various offline and online conversations with humanists](User:Deku-shrub)

In *Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age*^[Times Books, 2003], environmentalist [[Pages/Bill McKibben|Bill McKibben]] argues against enhancement and [[Pages/life extension|life extension]]. Conservative pundit [[Pages/Francis Fukuyama|Francis Fukuyama]] called transhumanism "the world’s most dangerous idea" in the journal *Foreign Policy*, elaborating, "The first victim of trans-humanism might be equality."^[Immortality 2.0: A Silicon Valley Insider Looks at California’s Transhumanist Movement](https://ce399eugenics.wordpress.com/2010/06/19/immortality-2-0-a-silicon-valley-insider-looks-at-californias-transhumanist-movement/)

The [[Pages/Italian Transhumanist Manifesto|Italian Transhumanist Manifesto]] explicitly rejects such accusations:^[[Italian Transhumanist Manifesto](http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/print/2520)]

> ''The accusation of plutocratic elitism'' - According to this critique, transhumanists are elite members of the upper middle classes, who plan to enhance themselves at a mental and physical level, becoming immortal demigods, a new superhuman species, in a best-case scenario ignoring the rest of their communities, and in the worst aiming at enslaving them.

## As a feminist concern
Many [[Pages/Feminism and transhumanism|feminist writings about transhumanism]] are concerned about the patriarchal inequalities possible under future transhumanist scenarios.

## In fiction
In such [[Pages/dystopian transhumanism|dystopian]] portrayals, the super-rich and/or powerful have access to the latest medical technologies, whereas the less well-off are denied access through means of costs, slavery, or simply selfishness on the part of those in power.

Portrayals in science fiction may often depict other dystopian elements present in [[Pages/fascist transhumanism|fascist transhumanism]], however, it is not inherently so. It is a common [[Pages/cyberpunk|cyberpunk]] theme, but less common in [[Pages/biopunk|biopunk]].

In certain portrayals, the establishment will be battling the [[Pages/Reactive transhumanism|brave resistance]] or [[Pages/Anarcho-Transhumanism|anarchists]], often as plucky underdogs from an anti-establishment point of view.

## Examples in fiction
* [[Pages/Jupiter Ascending|Jupiter Ascending]] - Billions of lives are killed to make a youth serum for the super-rich.
* [[Pages/Repo Men|Repo Men]] - Corporate enforcers kill organ recipients who default on their debts to reclaim the technology.
* [[Pages/Alien|Alien]] series and [[Pages/2001 A Space Odyssey|2001: A Space Odyssey]] - Of course, the evil corporate overlords are breaching series health and safety regulations with their [[Pages/Unfriendly AI|Unfriendly AI]] configurations.
* [[Pages/Elysium|Elysium]] - Depicts great inequality in access to medical care.
* [[Pages/Metropolis|Metropolis]] - Where [[Pages/android|androids]] are used as a tool of social manipulation in a futurist society with strong class divisions.
* [[Pages/Blade Runner|Blade Runner]] - Where super megacorporations control the world and begin plans to use biotechnologies to colonize planets, focusing on an ex-police officer-turned-independent private investigator hunting down four replicants or bio-cyborgs from those colonies that need to find a way to live longer.
* [[Pages/Continuum|Continuum]] - Featured a world ruled by a 'corporate congress' and '[[Pages/wage slavery|life debts]]'.
* [[Pages/Gattaca|Gattaca]] - Setting where [[Pages/Designer babies|genetically engineered babies]] (later grown up as GM humans) are treated as normal, while normal humans are slowly seen as nothing but "stereotypical" and "primitive". This means replacing normal with more GM babies to [[Pages/Eugenics|be perfect humans in the near future.]]
* [[Pages/BioShock|BioShock]] - Features fantasy-like [[Pages/genetic engineering|genetic engineering]] in a dystopian objectivist society or utopic religious right society in the third game.
* [[Pages/The Expanse|The Expanse]] - The principal antagonists are a multi-system mega-corporation.
