# Overview
The following is an original infographic designed by [[Deku-shrub|Deku-shrub]]. It is not considered exhaustive of various opinions, nor does every label imply a follower of that position is exclusively in that space. It is, however, designed to be a helpful introduction to a variety of [[Pages/futurist|futurist]] and [[Pages/transhumanist|transhumanist]] positions and to be used as a starting place to finding out more about them.

Ideas placed on the boundary of a section imply either the idea is transitional or disputed.
