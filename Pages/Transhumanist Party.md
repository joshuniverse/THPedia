**Transhumanist organisations** are many and varied and collectively influence much of the [[Pages/transhumanist community|transhumanist community]] as a whole.

## Overview
This article describes the organisations which comprise a small but growing global transhumanist political movement. Although these organisations vary in their priorities and their methods, they share the goal of promoting policies that further the objectives of transhumanism and transhumanists. Policies promoted by these organisations are described in the page [[Pages/Politics|Politics]].

## Transhumanist Think Tanks

## Transhumanist Party

The first organisation bearing the name "Transhumanist Party" was the [[Pages/U.S. Transhumanist Party|U.S. Transhumanist Party]] founded in October 2014 by [[Pages/Zoltan Istvan|Zoltan Istvan]] who announced his plan to run for US President under that banner.

A semi-formal [[Pages/Transhumanist Party Global|Transhumanist Party Global]] formed from activists involved in party formation internationally including [[Pages/Amon Twyman|Amon Twyman]]. This organisation has sought to coordinate the formation of various national political parties, often via [[Pages/Facebook|Facebook]] initially.

In the UK, [[Pages/Alex Karran|Alex Karran]] ran as an independent candidate in the May 2015 general election prior to [[Pages/Transhumanist UK|the UK party's]] official registration.^[[Cyborg supporting Transhumanist Party appoints first political candidate in UK](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/technology/cyborg-supporting-transhumanist-party-appoints-5494746)]

Shortly after the UK party's first AGM in October 2015, the UK party made a statement^[[Zoltan Istvan does not speak for the Transhumanist Party](https://transhumanistparty.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/zoltan-istvan-does-not-speak-for-the-transhumanist-party/)] stating that Zoltan does not have a 'real' political party and should claim no moral authority over the international movement.

Additionally, there are [[Pages/Transhumanist Party Global|associated groups]] in Canada, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Spain, and Sweden.

These are groups which use the name "Transhumanist Party" or are in some other way associated with the global Transhumanist Party movement, but are not officially recognised full affiliates with the movement. In most cases, that lack of recognition is due to a level of activity that is not yet mature enough to properly represent the movement in that region.
