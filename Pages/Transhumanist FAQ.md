**Transhumanist FAQ** is an important document in the [[Pages/history of transhumanism|history of transhumanism]], covering many key matters of philosophy, politics, and technology.

It has been developed collaboratively since the mid-1990s to the present day by a large number of transhumanists.

* An archive of v3 of the document, copied from the Humanity+ website, is available at [[Pages/Transhumanist FAQ Version 3|Transhumanist FAQ Version 3]].
* A newer version, evolved and maintained by the [[Pages/THPedia|THPedia]] project, is available at [[Pages/Transhumanist FAQ Live|Transhumanist FAQ Live]].

## History of the Transhumanist FAQ

*The following information is adapted from the introductory section of [[Pages/Transhumanist FAQ Version 3|Transhumanist FAQ Version 3]].*

The Transhumanist FAQ was developed in the mid-1990s and in 1998 became a formal FAQ through the work of transhumanists, including [[Pages/Alexander Chislenko|Alexander Chislenko]], [[Pages/Max More|Max More]], [[Pages/Anders Sandberg|Anders Sandberg]], [[Pages/Natasha Vita-More|Natasha Vita-More]], [[Pages/Eliezer Yudkowsky|Eliezer Yudkowsky]], [[Pages/Arjen Kamphius|Arjen Kamphius]], and many others.

Several people contributed to the definition of transhumanism, which was originated by Max More. [[Pages/Greg Burch|Greg Burch]], [[Pages/David Pearce|David Pearce]], [[Pages/Kathryn Aegis|Kathryn Aegis]], and Anders Sandberg kindly offered extensive editorial comments.

The presentation in the [[Pages/cryonics|cryonics]] section was, and still is, directly inspired by an article by [[Pages/Ralph Merkle|Ralph Merkle]].

Ideas, criticisms, questions, phrases, and sentences to the original version were contributed by (in alphabetical order): Kathryn Aegis, Alex (intech@intsar.com), [[Pages/Brent Allsop|Brent Allsop]], [[Pages/Brian Atkins|Brian Atkins]], [[Pages/Scott Badger|Scott Badger]], [[Pages/Doug Bailey|Doug Bailey]], [[Pages/Harmony Baldwin|Harmony Baldwin]], [[Pages/Damien Broderick|Damien Broderick]], Greg Burch, [[Pages/David Cary|David Cary]], [[Pages/John K Clark|John K Clark]], [[Pages/Dan Clemensen|Dan Clemensen]], [[Pages/Damon Davis|Damon Davis]], [[Pages/Jeff Dee|Jeff Dee]], [[Pages/Jean-Michel Delhotel|Jean-Michel Delhotel]], [[Pages/Dylan Evans|Dylan Evans]], EvMick@aol.com, [[Pages/Daniel Fabulich|Daniel Fabulich]], [[Pages/Frank Forman|Frank Forman]], [[Pages/Robin Hanson|Robin Hanson]], [[Pages/Andrew Hennessey|Andrew Hennessey]], [[Pages/Tony Hollick|Tony Hollick]], [[Pages/Joe Jenkins|Joe Jenkins]], [[Pages/William John|William John]], [[Pages/Michelle Jones|Michelle Jones]], [[Pages/Arjen Kamphius|Arjen Kamphius]], [[Pages/Henri Kluytmans|Henri Kluytmans]], [[Pages/Eugene Leitl|Eugene Leitl]], [[Pages/Mike Lorrey|Michael Lorrey]], mark@unicorn.com, [[Pages/Peter C. McCluskey|Peter C. McCluskey]], [[Pages/Erik Moeller|Erik Moeller]], [[Pages/J. R. Molloy|J. R.

Over the years, this FAQ has been updated to provide a substantial account of transhumanism. [[Pages/Extropy Institute|Extropy Institute]] (ExI) was a source of information for the first version of the Transhumanist FAQ, version 1.0 in the 1990s. [[Pages/WTA|WTA]] adopted the FAQ in 2001 and [[Pages/Nick Bostrom|Nick Bostrom]] added substantial information about future scenarios. However, with the contributions of close to a hundred people from ExI, Aleph, [[Pages/Transcedo|Transcedo]], and the [[Pages/WTA|WTA]], new material has been added and many old sections have been substantially reworked.

In the preparation of version 2.0, the following people have been especially helpful: [[Pages/Eliezer Yudkowsky|Eliezer Yudkowsky]], who provided editorial assistance with comments on particular issues of substance; [[Pages/Dale Carrico|Dale Carrico]] who proofread the first half of the text; and [[Pages/Michael LaTorra|Michael LaTorra]] who did the same for the second half; and “[[Pages/Reason|Reason]]” who then went over the whole document again, as did [[Pages/Frank Forman|Frank Forman]], and [[Pages/Sarah Banks Forman|Sarah Banks Forman]]. Useful comments of either substance or form have also been contributed by (in alphabetical order): [[Pages/Michael Anissimov|Michael Anissimov]], [[Pages/Samantha Atkins|Samantha Atkins]], [[Pages/Milan Cirkovic|Milan Cirkovic]], [[Pages/José Luis Cordeiro|José Luis Cordeiro]], [[Pages/George Dvorsky|George Dvorsky]], [[Pages/James Hughes|James Hughes]], [[Pages/G.E. Jordan|G.E. Jordan]], [[Pages/Vasso Kambourelli|Vasso Kambourelli]], [[Pages/Michael LaTorra|Michael LaTorra]], [[Pages/Eugen Leitl|Eugen Leitl]], [[Pages/Juan Meridalva|Juan Meridalva]], [[Pages/Harvey Newstrom|Harvey Newstrom]], [[Pages/Emlyn O’Reagan|Emlyn O’Reagan]], [[Pages/Christine Peterson|Christine Peterson]], [[Pages/Giulio Prisco|Giulio Prisco]], [[Pages/Reason|Reason]], [[Pages/Rafal Smigrodzki|Rafal Smigrodzki]], [[Pages/Simon Smith|Simon Smith]], [[Pages/Mike Treder|Mike Treder]], and [[Pages/Mark Walker|Mark Walker]].

Many others have over the years offered questions or reflections that have in some way helped shape this document.

A version from December 2003 can be found at [https://web.archive.org/web/20031208110203/http://extropy.org/faq.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20031208110203/http://extropy.org/faq.htm). That document contains the following historical note:

<blockquote>

***8.1 When was the FAQ written?***  The FAQ is a compilation of transhumanist writings since 1989.  Many of the ideas of transhumanity were covered in Extropy Institute's *Extropy: The Journal of Transhumanist Thought* from the late 1980s through the late 1990s, and which have been referenced in our FAQ.  In order to provide state-of-the-art reliability, ExI's FAQ has been revised over the years to provide accurate answers to the crucial questions about transhumanity and the role of extropy since its earliest beginnings and its far future.

***8.2 Who created the FAQ?***  Members of Extropy Institute have provided information for the FAQ.  Special thanks goes to Dr. Max More, Greg Burch, Natasha Vita-More, Harvey Newstrom, Riley Jones, Prof. Tom Bell, Christine Peterson, Dr. Eric Drexler, Prof. Marvin Minsky, Dave Krieger, E. Shaun Russell, Ziana Astralos, Anand and [many others to be includd here.]

***8.3 Is it the only Transhumanist FAQ?***  There are many transhumanist FAQs available on the Internet. As the original transhumanist organization, Extropy Institute's goal is to provide an accurate and reliable FAQ for the growing culture of transhumanity.
