# THPedia Articles Guidelines

Articles in THPedia are expected to be written either from the **point of view** of someone who identifies with the transhumanist movement or someone with an awareness of transhumanism. This position can be a positive or negative approach, as long as it adds transhumanist context.

All articles should have intersectionality with [[Emerging Technologies]], [[Comparison of Futurist Related Ideas and Positions|transhumanism, futurism, life extension, etc.]], otherwise, they may be considered off-topic or improperly written.
