# Eugenics

**Eugenics** is the practice of improving the genetic quality of a species, or of a particular race, breed, group, lineage, nation, or jurisdiction thereof, via various practices. The opposite of eugenics is **dysgenics**, which is the deliberate breeding of bad traits. In practice, the terms "eugenics" and "dysgenics" are usually applied to the human species in particular, though they apply to all species.

Eugenics is sometimes divided into "positive eugenics" and "negative eugenics."

"Positive eugenics" emphasizes breeding people with good genes, whereas "negative eugenics" emphasizes sterilizing, or otherwise preventing the breeding of, people with bad genes. There is also the distinction between voluntary eugenics and involuntary eugenics. Transhumanists have universally expressed opposition to "negative eugenics" or involuntary eugenics of any nature. Dr. [[Pages/Dan Elton|Dan Elton]], who is sympathetic toward expressing the connection between transhumanism and eugenics, has explained, "I am not aware of any transhumanist ever advocating for coercive eugenics. In fact, the transhumanist movement tends to skew libertarian, away from government intervention. If one defines eugenics in a broad way ('advocating for the creation of better humans'), then transhumanism is very much eugenicist."^<ref>Dan Elton.

## Eugenics in Relation to Transhumanism
While some make the argument that genetic transhumanism is a type of high-tech eugenics, many transhumanists desire to distance themselves from eugenics, due to the common cultural associations of eugenics with pseudoscientific views and coercive activities, as well as human rights violations that were perpetrated during the first half of the 20th century.

[[Dan Elton]] has written that "Germline genetic engineering has certainly been discussed by some transhumanists, but it is a tiny fraction of what transhumanists advocate for. Germline genetic engineering is certainly eugenics, in so far as it is done to improve the health and wellbeing of children, but it’s hard to argue it’s bad when the child clearly benefits and it is undertaken voluntarily with full information regarding risks. As shocking as it may sound, a lot of “eugenics” is actually fine and non-controversial. We just don’t call it eugenics because of the terrible connotations that word has taken on."^<ref>Dan Elton.

The term '[[Pages/Liberal eugenics|liberal eugenics]]', coined by [[Pages/Nicholas Agar|Nicholas Agar]], attempts to address the issues of eugenic coercion, arguing from a position based on individual procreative freedom and parental choice, with state intervention only to prohibit choices deemed injurious to the child.

Those who advocate using the term 'liberal eugenics' have sought to focus on reclaiming the positive elements such as in-utero treatment of genetic conditions, but this term remains unpopular, such that some transhumanists prefer^<ref>[No, transhumanists do not support eugenics, we support super babies](http://pirate.london/2015/11/no-transhumanists-do-not-support-eugenics-we-support-super-babies/)</ref> the term '[[Pages/Superhumans|super babies]]' instead.

## Criticism of Eugenics

Eugenics is heavily criticized in mainstream discourse. Critics assert that advocacy of eugenics is typically based on [[Pages/junk science|junk science]] that overstates the role of hereditary traits in personal development and overlooks environmental and social factors, frequently to excuse classism and [[Pages/scientific racism|scientific racism]]. Transhumanism, as a system of thought that seeks to benefit all of humanity, is necessarily opposed to racism and classism.^<ref>A prominent example of transhumanists' strong opposition to racism and classism can be found in the [U.S. Transhumanist Party Platform](https://transhumanist-party.org/platform/), Section II:

"The United States Transhumanist Party supports all acceptance, tolerance, and inclusivity of individuals and groups of all races, genders, classes, religions, creeds, and ideologies. Accordingly, the United States Transhumanist Party condemns any hostile discrimination or legal restrictions on the basis of national origin, skin color, birthplace, ancestry, gender identity, or any manner of circumstantial attribute tied to a person’s lineage or accident of birth. Furthermore, the United States Transhumanist Party strongly opposes any efforts to enforce said restrictions regardless of cause or motivation thereof. Additionally, any institution that uses violence, suppression of free speech, or other unconstitutional or otherwise illegal methods will be disavowed and condemned by the United States Transhumanist Party, with an efficient, non-violent alternative to said institution being offered to achieve its goals if they align with the Party’s interests."</ref> Accordingly, many transhumanists refrain from associating themselves with the term "eugenics" to avoid the misapplication of these allegations to transhumanism. 

## History of Eugenics

### Ancient History
Very early philosophical precursors of eugenics may be found in Plato's *[[Pages/Republic|Republic]]* c. 400 BCE, suggesting applying selective breeding practices. Early Roman law mandated the infanticide of deformed children. Most ancient ideas in this area would be considered deeply antithetical to transhumanism today.

### The "Kallikak" Family
In 1912, the eugenics movement was further advanced by the publication of *[[Pages/The Kallikak Family|The Kallikak Family: A Study in the Heredity of Feeble-Mindedness]]* by [[Pages/Henry H. Goddard|Henry H. Goddard]] and its subsequent popularity. The book portrays a falsified history of a family divided into "good" and "bad" branches to demonstrate the heredity of "feeble-mindedness."

In truth, the families were unrelated, and many of the portrayed deficiencies of the "bad" branch of the family were fabricated or heavily embellished, while non-hereditary factors such as nutritional deficiencies and fetal alcohol syndrome were ignored.
