**Singularity University** (SU) is a think tank and business incubator that previously offered educational programs. Its stated aim is to “educate, inspire and empower leaders to apply exponential technologies to address humanity’s challenges." It was founded in 2008 by [[Pages/Peter Diamandis|Peter Diamandis]] and [[Pages/Ray Kurzweil|Ray Kurzweil]] at NASA Ames Research Park in California.

In 2012, the organization transitioned from a nonprofit to for-profit.^[[Wired: Singularity University Converging Into Capitalist Machine](https://www.wired.com/2012/07/singularity-u/)] expanding to establish local chapters around the world and offering exclusive seminars primarily supported by uncompensated students and volunteers.

The organization's corporate ethics and business model have been criticized by [[Pages/Nikola Danaylov|Nikola Danaylov]], ^[[Bloomberg Businessweek: Silicon Valley’s Singularity University Has Some Serious Reality Problems](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-15/silicon-valley-s-singularity-university-has-some-serious-reality-problems)] and ^[[TechCrunch: Beyond the BS of Singularity U’s $32M raise to teach trends](https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/15/singularity-university/)] among others, facing allegations of assault, corruption, and fraud from students, employees, and alumni.

SU recently closed a $32M round of funding with defense contractor Boeing while canceling its summer studies program, which many considered the heart of the organization.

The organization publishes futurist news on [[Pages/Singularity Hub|Singularity Hub]].
