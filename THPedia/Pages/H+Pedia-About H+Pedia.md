> This page on the Transhumanism wiki may have been merged from an external source. It currently serves as a potential starting point, though it lacks the extensive detail and coverage typically expected of a comprehensive knowledge resource. We encourage contributors to enhance and expand this entry with additional information and reliable sources to improve its depth and accuracy.

The primary purpose of H+Pedia is to spread accurate, accessible, non-sensationalistic information about [[transhumanism]] among the general public. H+Pedia is also an opportunity for transhumanist enthusiasts to work together, thereby strengthening the [[transhumanist community]].H+Pedia welcomes constructive contributions from everyone interested in the future of humanity.
## What's it all about?

H+Pedia aims to follow the principles of [[Wikipedia]]. At the same time, the H+Pedia editorial team seek to demonstrate [[H+Pedia-Transhumanist point of view|greater awareness]] and appreciation of transhumanism and [[radical futurism]]. This will be reflected by the inclusion in H+Pedia of material which might not pass the Wikipedia tests for notability, as currently applied by Wikipedia editors. The guiding principles of H+Pedia are described in more detail in [[H+Pedia principles]]
## Contributors policy

H+Pedia is an open project, meaning that anyone may contribute either under their own name and public identity, or pseudo-anonymously via a preferred username.

The project focuses on [[Techno-optimism|techno-optimistic]] and realistic futuristic thought and trend analysis, rather than taking a popularist position that [[Dystopia|dystopian]] scenarios are inevitable and unavoidable.

[[H+Pedia-Citation needed|Original research]] is welcomed at H+Pedia, however such contributions are expected to draw heavily upon reliable resources and other [[H+Pedia-Wikification|internal H+Pedia references]].

Users who hold a specialist interest or expertise are invited to write about this on their user page or article page to better contextualise their contributions.

## Etiquette

As with [[Wikipedia]], discussions should to be focused around the content of a contribution rather than the user who made it. However in the event that an individual is sufficiently disruptive to the H+Pedia project or wider community they may no longer be allowed to contribute.
