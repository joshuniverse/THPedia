## How to run it locally

The wiki can be used offline and can be used as-is or incorporated into your own personal knowledge management system. It is built to be used with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (free, no affiliation) but is compatible with other tools as well such as [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) or [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/).

1. Download this GitHub repository.
2. Download the free [Obsidian desktop app](https://obsidian.md/).
3. Run the Obsidian app and choose **Open folder as vault**, click **Open**.
4. In the file browser, choose the folder where you downloaded the GitHub repository, click **Open**.

See [Obsidian help](https://help.obsidian.md/) for questions on using Obsidian.
