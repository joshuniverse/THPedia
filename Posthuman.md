# Posthuman Transhumanism

**Posthuman transhumanism** or to be **posthuman** refers to a state of existence beyond the limits of [[Pages/transhuman|transhuman]] [[biological immortalists]], transcending definitions of humanity into the era of posthuman existence.

This specific form of [[Pages/posthumanism|posthumanism]] is a realization of the most advanced and speculative transhumanist ideas dealing with the technologies and forms of the far future. Typically [[Pages/mind uploading|mind uploading]] or similar forms of [[Pages/consciousness transfer|consciousness transfer]] will be involved to reach this state. The entity may be [[Pages/Super intelligence|super intelligent]].

In a [[Pages/spiritual transhumanism|spiritualist tradition]], the idea may be influenced by the [[Pages/Omega Point|Omega Point]]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_Point Wikipedia:Omega Point] or [[Pages/Pleroma|Pleroma]]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleroma Wikipedia:Pleroma].

## Boundary definitions

[[Pages/Adam Ford|Adam Ford]] suggests the following distinctions from more mainstream transhumanism:<ref>![Will we become posthuman?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90cqkzzDT8U) - [[Adam Ford]]</ref>

<blockquote>One whose basic capacities so radically exceed those of present humans as to be no longer ambiguously human by our current standards

May have gone beyond human form

May have updated the genetic kernel - or even discarded it during a complete overhaul</blockquote>

## Archetypes
* **Formless:**
  * [[Pages/Infomorph|Infomorphs]] - living as a transient energy being of some kind
  * [[Pages/Avatarism|Avatars]] - existing in different bodies or [[Pages/transhuman|transhuman]] forms such as [[Pages/cyborg|cyborgs]]
  * As [[Pages/Simulationists|Simulations]] - existing within one or more simulations
  * A merger of humanity and [[Pages/artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] into a [[Pages/singleton|singleton]], without ties to biological form or even human-like thought
  * [[Pages/Omega Point|Omega Point]] - existing as a God-like omnipotent force permeating the universe
* **Formed:**
  * [[Pages/Matrioshka brain|Matrioshka or Jupiter brain]]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrioshka_brain] - existing as a massive ultra-dense engine of computation, or even further up the [[Pages/Kardashev scale|Kardashev scale]]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale].
  * A [[Pages/hive mind|hive mind]] may function collectively as a posthuman form of existence, though individual members are typically [[Pages/transhuman|transhuman]].

## Examples in fiction
* The mainstream pop-culture concept of [[Pages/extraterrestrial beings|extraterrestrial beings]] may consider them as either transhuman or posthuman beings.
* The Vorlons from [[Pages/Babylon 5|Babylon 5]] are energy-based infomorphs that interact with the younger races via cyborg body avatars.
* The Star Child from [[Pages/2001 A Space Odyssey|2001: A Space Odyssey]] is some kind of transhuman or infomorph.
* The First Sirian Bank in [[Pages/The Dark Side of the Sun|The Dark Side of the Sun]]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Sun] is a [[Pages/computronium|computronium]] matrioshka brain.
* The Sentient Intelligence 'SI' in the [[Pages/commonwealth saga|Commonwealth Saga]] is a friendly [[Pages/superintelligence|superintelligence]]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Saga#Sentient_Intelligence].
* [[Pages/Star Trek|Star Trek]]
  * [[Pages/Star Trek V|Star Trek V]]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_V:_The_Final_Frontier] - 'God' claims to be some kind of Omega Point entity. But why does God need a starship?
  * [[Pages/The Borg|The Borg]] are collectively, but not individually a transhuman [[Pages/hive mind|hive mind]].
  * The [[Pages/Q|Q]] possess a partial hive mind identity, go to war in simulations and are typically described as omnipotent.
