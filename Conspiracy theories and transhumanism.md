**Conspiracy theories and transhumanism** often go hand-in-hand.

## Themes

### Anti-Semitism
Conspiracy sites such as Rightpedia associate prominent Jewish transhumanists with the usual Satanic nonsense.^<ref>https://en.rightpedia.info/w/Transhumanism</ref>

### Artificial Intelligence

Some conspiracy theorists testify that self-improving artificial intelligences and robots are killing labs full of scientists.^[https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ai-robots-kill-scientists/ Did Four AI Robots Kill 29 Scientists in Japan? - Snopes] Trolls have made up the idea of a secret AI called [[Pages/CAIMEO|CAIMEO]] having escaped from a lab and hiding out on the dark web.

### DARPA
[[Pages/DARPA|DARPA]]'s research into human augmentation division in its new Biological Technologies Office provides much conspiracy fodder.^<ref>[https://occupycorporatism.com/8-examples-transhumanist-future-according-darpa/ 8 Examples of a Transhumanist Future According to DARPA]</ref>^<ref>[http://io9.gizmodo.com/darpas-new-biotech-division-wants-to-create-a-transhum-1556857603 DARPA's New Biotech Division Wants To Create A Transhuman Future]</ref>^<ref>[http://hplusmagazine.com/2015/02/15/biology-technology-darpa-back-game-big-vision-h/ Biology is Technology — DARPA is Back in the Game With A Big Vision and It Is H+]</ref>

### Illuminati
This video entitled [[Pages/Lady Gaga|Lady Gaga]] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPtPtC90tuY EXPOSES the Illuminati and the Facebook Transhuman Agenda] links Lady Gaga, [[Pages/Facebook|Facebook]], and transhumanism together confusingly.

The leaders of [[Pages/MIRI|MIRI]] have been implicated as a part of shadowy plots.^[http://www.conspiracyschool.com/blog/global-mind-transhumanism-freemasonry-and-internet-god Global Mind: Transhumanism, Freemasonry and the Internet as God]

### Music
[[Pages/Steve Aoki|Steve Aoki]]'s videos have been viewed suspiciously by transhumanist conspiracy theorists.^<ref>[http://illuminatiwatcher.com/transhuman-symbolism-in-steve-aokis-singularity-music-video/ Transhuman symbolism in Steve Aoki’s ‘Singularity’ music video]</ref>

### Oligarchy
The high-profile nature of some [[Pages/Silicon Valley|Silicon Valley]] [[Pages/libertarian transhumanism|libertarians]] such as [[Pages/Peter Thiel|Peter Thiel]] or billionaires like [[Pages/Dmitry Itskov|Dmitry Itskov]] has created a strong public association of [[Pages/oligarchic transhumanism|oligarchy]] with the idea for many. This in turn plays easily into the hands of conspiracy theorists.

### Religion
![[450px-Cyberpunk_Culture.jpg]]
*We're screwed*

Transhumanism is often presented as an enemy of, or otherwise attacking and infiltrating religion.^[http://www.blessedquietness.com/journal/housechu/transhumanism_infects_christendom.htm Transhumanism Infects Christendom] Considerable effort by YouTubers such as [[Pages/The Vigilant Christian|The Vigilant Christian]] and [[Pages/Nicholson1968|Nicholson1968]] is expended on these ideas.

### Satanism

### Zoltan Istvan
