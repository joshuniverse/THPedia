# Transhumanism as a Religion

![[450px-Religion.jpg]]

**Transhumanism** has been compared to a **religion** from time to time. One can analyze this comparison by examining existing definitions of religions.^[https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=religion+definition Google: religion definition]

## Overview

Many transhumanist commentators such as theologian [[Pages/Ted Peters|Ted Peters]] have made favorable characterizations of transhumanism as a religious movement.

Albert R. Antosca suggests transhumanism blurs the link between strictly atheistic and religious beliefs.^[https://slate.com/technology/2018/03/transhumanism-is-complicating-the-relationship-between-faith-and-science.html?via=recirc_recent Thinking Outside the Old Religious Box: Transhumanism is complicating the sometimes antagonistic relationship between faith and science.]

## The Belief in and Worship of a Superhuman Controlling Power, Especially a Personal God or Gods

*Example: "ideas about the relationship between science and religion"*

### God
Belief in a god or the supernatural is not inherently required by transhumanism, a position very strongly held by many [[Pages/atheistic transhumanism|atheistic transhumanists]], some of whom argue transhumanism is, or should be, inherently atheistic. However, there are a number of [[Pages/religious transhumanism|religious groups]] involved in transhumanism such as the [[Pages/Christian Transhumanist Association|Christian Transhumanist Association]] and [[Pages/Mormon Transhumanist Association|Mormon Transhumanist Association]]. So what does this mean?

### Spiritualism
Although not all transhumanists believe in a higher power, many individuals and some groups within the movement as a whole may take alternative positions. An increasing number of people describe themselves as [[Pages/spiritual transhumanism|spiritual but not religious]] and would not fall under this definition. [[Pages/Buddhist transhumanism|Buddhist transhumanism]] is arguably more spiritual than religious.

Individuals such as [[Pages/Ben Goertzel|Ben Goertzel]] have expressed an interest in [[Pages/panpsychism|panpsychism]]. There may be other such positions within the community.

### Postsecularism
[[Pages/Postsecularism|Postsecularism]] is sometimes used as a descriptor of the movement to describe the complex convergence of these views as applied to the movement.^[http://lincoln.metacannon.net/2014/09/transhumanism-is-not-atheism-and-is.html Transhumanism is not Atheism and is often Misrecognized Religion]

## A Particular System of Faith and Worship

*Example: "the world's great religions"*

### Faith
[[Pages/Transhumanist|Transhumanists]] could be argued to have faith in certain [[Pages/techno-optimism|techno-optimistic ideas]], such as hope for the future or anticipation of various future desirable scenarios. Transhumanists may consider [[Pages/goals of transhumanism|transhumanistic goals]] as [[Pages/transhumanist inevitablism|transhumanist inevitablism]], scenarios such as an [[Pages/AI|AI]] that helps humanity, maybe a technology that can save the world's ecosystem, or [[Pages/emerging technologies|emerging technologies]] covered here and in [[Pages/transhumanist community|the community]]. Not all transhumanists are likely to agree with this specific goal or endpoint. Some may have their hopes pinned on [[Pages/the singularity|the singularity]], others may see new [[Pages/life extension|life extension]] technologies coming via [[Pages/Biological immortalists|biological methods]], and some are just in it for the [[Pages/Cyborgization|laser guns and robotic legs]] that make them run like [[Pages/Super powers|The Flash]].

### Worship
There is an element of [[Pages/cult of personality in transhumanism|cult of personality]] associated with prominent figures such as [[Pages/Ray Kurzweil|Ray Kurzweil]] and his [[Pages/telepresence robot|telepresence robot]] appearances, or [[Pages/Aubrey de Grey|Aubrey de Grey]] and [[Pages/Aubrey de Grey's beard|his outstanding beard]]. Elements of [[Pages/technophilia|technophilia]] could be comparable, as well as [[Pages/scientism|scientism]] and [[Pages/technoprogressivism|technoprogressivism]] and other political ideas. Few would argue these relationships constitute worship, however.

### Structures
A few small initiatives have directly brought together the ideas of transhumanism or life extensionism into new age-type initiatives:
* [[Pages/The First Church of the Singularity|The First Church of the Singularity]]^[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2137140720/the-first-church-of-the-singularity-rokos-basilica?lang=de On the playa this year, experience reality as a crowd-sourced sim. "First Church of the Singularity". Take the red pill]
* [[Pages/Church of Perpetual Life|Church of Perpetual Life]]
* [[Pages/Church of Virus|Church of Virus]]

There are, however, a very fringe element of the movement.

[[Pages/Religious transhumanism|Religious transhumanism]] associated with established religion tends to provide a continuity of the existing structures rather than developing exclusively transhumanist ones.

## A Pursuit or Interest to Which Someone Ascribes Supreme Importance

*Example: "consumerism is the new religion"*

Many trends in popular culture have been compared to religions, from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian Kim Kardashian]'s ass, through to belief in alien abductions or [[Pages/conspiracy theories and transhumanism|conspiracy theories]].

It is not clear how seriously a typical transhumanist rates the movement in their life. Indeed, there may be many [[Pages/de facto transhumanist|de facto transhumanists]] who work entirely independently of the movement.

Certain advocates such as [[Pages/Eliezer Yudkowsky|Eliezer Yudkowsky]] have showcased the importance of the idea through their writings, whilst [[Pages/People Unlimited|People Unlimited]] use evangelical-style energetic rhetoric to motivate people about longevity. These may be exceptions, however.

## Transhumanism as a Cult

One other similar term sometimes used by anti-transhumanists is to describe transhumanism as a cult.

### Simple Definition of 'Cult'
* A small religious group that is not part of a larger and more accepted religion and that has beliefs regarded by many people as extreme or dangerous.
* A situation in which people admire and care about something or someone very much or too much.
* A small group of very devoted supporters or fans.^[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cult Definition of Cult]

Definition 1 is taken care of above; let's look at the other 2 points.

*A situation in which people admire and care about something or someone very much or too much*

If you can define "very much" or "too much," then yes, it could be described as a cult. It's no more a cult than anything else in the world, though. Animal rights activists could be called cultists, fan bases of sports teams large and small, etc. etc. Ditto for the next definition:

*A small group of very devoted supporters or fans*

Again, the term "cult" can be applied to almost anything.

Reasons for labeling it a cult are most likely because of the negative connotations associated with the word. Largely used by dark mainstream media conglomerates who want to control your mind with their programming. (see how persuasion works?)
