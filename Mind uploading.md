**Mind uploading** is the hypothetical process of copying, moving, or simply reassociating one's memories, personality, consciousness, and/or personal identity from their original physical system (primarily the brain) to a computer.

Mind uploading is considered the likely long-term solution to [[Pages/life extension|life extension]] to protect against physical harm. Such prospective technology and whether a 'self' or personal identity can be copied or moved to, or reassociated with, another substrate is a popular debating point amongst transhumanists and futurists.

Mind uploading is a key piece of technology required to go beyond potential [[Pages/Biological immortalists|biological immortality]] into [[Pages/posthuman transhumanism|posthuman transhumanism]]. It has been proposed that mind uploading is the likely progression of [[Pages/alien intelligence|alien intelligence]] wherever it arises in the cosmos and that we should conduct SETI along such lines.^[[What if the aliens we're looking for are AI?](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160922-what-if-the-aliens-we-are-looking-for-are-ai)] ^[[Beyond Humanity: CyberEvolution and Future Minds](https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Humanity-Gregory-S-Paul/dp/1886801215)] ^[[The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence](https://www.amazon.com/Age-Spiritual-Machines-Computers-Intelligence/dp/0140282025)]. Similarly, mind uploading has been proposed as a required prerequisite for feasible [[Pages/space exploration|interstellar travel]].^[[Mind Uploading and The Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything](http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/wiley20150720)]

## Theoretical possibility
Much of the possibility of emulating a human or human-like mind assumes that such processes are computable in accordance with the [[Pages/Church–Turing thesis|Church–Turing thesis]].^[[Wikipedia:Church–Turing thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church–Turing_thesis)] The existence of non-computable neural functions such as soul or overly complex quantum state function would invalidate this possibility.

Even allowing for the possibility of a computer-based human mind, there are many challenges with regards to continuity of consciousness and personal identity which must be addressed in order to prevent a break in identity and self.

## Methods
### Destructive Whole Brain Emulation
'Scan and copy,' sometimes advocated as the only way to create true [[Pages/artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]], [[Pages/whole brain emulation|whole brain emulation]] is a computationally intensive approach whereby an entire human brain—from the neuron up—is simulated within a computer system.

Existing and near-future MRI technology would be used to copy the running state of a brain in a fashion analogous to a computer undergoing a [[Pages/Physical-to-Virtual|physical-to-virtual]] migration.

Unlike a computer, however, current non-invasive imaging technology does not provide a sufficient theoretical resolution; only destructive methods do. If you don't believe [[Pages/Voyages of the Ship of Theseus|the uploaded version is still you]], you may have a problem.

### Non-destructive uploading
*Main [[Pages/Non-destructive uploading|Non-destructive uploading]]*

Non-destructive uploading looks at future technology which would allow consciousness to be transferred without the original brain being destroyed. Whilst this is good news for you, you end up with the trouble with transporters whereby there could be more than one of you!

### Gradual in-place replacement
Gradual in-place replacement^[[A Taxonomy and Metaphysics of Mind-Uploading](https://www.example.com)] is a method of gradually incrementing augmentation of a mind with a digital substrate. As minds receive more [[Pages/brain-computer interface|neutral enhancements]], they may in time possess the ability to offload memories, process non-critical ideas remotely and allow your [[Pages/digital self|digital self]] to perform independent activities on your behalf.

'Division scenarios' include approaches such as cutting a brain in two or more sections, scanning each, and replacing half with computerized sections.

Should a critical mass of storage and processing ever be offloaded to remote systems, this could allow the original body to die without interruption to consciousness.^[[Wikipedia:It’s time to write about mind-uploading](https://pirate.london/its-time-to-write-about-mind-uploading-14e70e9489e0)]

## Uses
Mind uploading has a variety of utilities:

### Immortality
[[Pages/Immortality|Immortality]]! Live beyond even the limits of [[Pages/biological immortality|biological immortality]] as a [[Pages/posthuman transhumanism|posthuman]], [[Pages/cyborg|cyborg]], or [[Pages/consciousness transfer|in a new body]]. [[Pages/life extension|Life extension]] to the max? You might need this.

### Backup
You may be dead, but with a [[Pages/mind backup|mind backup]], it doesn't need to mean you're gone! Whilst deceased—you may not be comforted by a backup version of you taking over your life—think of the many benefits to friends, family, and society that backup-you might have to offer! Possibly the last frontier of [[Pages/intellectual property|intellectual property]]. There are several projects of the [[Pages/Terasem Movement|Terasem Movement]] exploring this idea. Sci-fi epic [[Pages/Pandora's Star|Pandora's Star]]^[[Wikipedia:Commonwealth Saga#Longevity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Saga#Longevity)] explores this with an always-on Internet connection.

### Explore the final frontier
Existing in [[Pages/posthuman transhumanism|posthuman form]], which is long-lived and resilient to space radiation, may be the only realistic way for long-term [[Pages/space exploration|space exploration]] to take place.

### Simulated you is probably expendable
[[Pages/Simulationism|Simulations]]—the ability to simulate people in order to predict how they'll react—is already a core technology in internet profiling and advertising. The logical conclusion is to copy or simulate whole people for perfect simulations. But does [[Pages/Sentient rights|simulated-you have rights]]?
