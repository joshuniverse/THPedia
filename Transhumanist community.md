## Pros and Cons of Different Tools for Building a Community

### Facebook
The drawbacks of [[Pages/Facebook|Facebook]] are that:
* Some people prefer not to have a Facebook account, fearing that Facebook all too easily becomes a time sink.
* Facebook admins can decide to delete or suspend someone's account, sometimes for seemingly arbitrary reasons.

The advantages of Facebook are that:
* It undergoes rapid development, with new features being added regularly - therefore it is feature-rich.
* Facebook puts a high focus on good user experience.
* It is easier to check if a new applicant to join a group has a past online history elsewhere on Facebook, which informs a decision whether to accept or reject them.

### Slack
Advantages of Slack include:
* Support for integration of new services.
* Users are notified when they are mentioned in postings.

### LinkedIn
(Info should be added about LinkedIn)
