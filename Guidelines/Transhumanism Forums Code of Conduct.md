The Transhumanism Community is steadfastly committed to maintaining an environment of respect and openness, free from harassment. We extend this commitment to everyone, irrespective of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body type, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, religion, or lifestyle choices. Harassment, in any shape or form, will not be tolerated and may lead to sanctions or expulsion from the community.

This Code of Conduct is designed to protect our community members and create a safe and positive environment for discussion and collaboration.

# I. Guidelines:

## 1. **Respect and Courtesy:**

Disparaging comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion are strictly prohibited.

## 2. **Freedom of Lifestyle Choices:**

Comments that disrespect or judge a person's lifestyle choices, including food, health, parenting, drugs, employment, and body modification, are not welcome.

## 3. **Gender Identity:**

Misgendering deliberately, or using dead or rejected names, is not permitted.

## 4. **Sexual Conduct:**

Displaying sexual images or behaviors where they are inappropriate or unwelcome is strictly prohibited.

## 5. **Physical Boundaries:**

Physical contact, even in text form (such as "hug" or "backrub"), is prohibited without consent, and must cease immediately upon request.

## 6. **Violent Behaviors:**

Threats of violence, incitement of violence, and deliberate intimidation are forbidden.

## 7. **Privacy and Safety:**

Stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, and documenting online activity for harassment purposes will not be tolerated.

## 8. **Harmonious Discussion:**

Sustained disruption of discussion is not permissible.

## 9. **Inappropriate Contact:**

Unwanted sexual attention, inappropriate levels of social contact, or continuing one-on-one communication after a request to cease are strictly forbidden.

## 10. **Respect for Identity:**

Deliberately revealing any aspect of a person's identity, activities, or modifications without their explicit consent is prohibited unless it is necessary for the safety of others.

# II. Prioritizing Safety:

The Transhumanism Community prioritizes the safety of marginalized individuals over the comfort of privileged individuals. We will not act on complaints about:

- 'Reverse' -isms, such as 'reverse racism,' 'reverse sexism,' and 'cisphobia.'
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you."
- Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial.
- Criticism of harmful, racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.

# III. Consequences of Violating the Code of Conduct:

Anyone instructed to stop any form of harassment is expected to comply immediately. Violators of this Code of Conduct may face actions deemed appropriate by the Transhumanism Community organizers, up to and including being banned from all Transhumanism Community spaces, and public identification as a harasser to other community members.

# IV. Reporting and Enforcement:

If you encounter harassment within the Transhumanism Community, witness someone else being harassed, or have any other concerns, we strongly encourage you to report this immediately. Please contact us at [spacetimebull@protonmail.com](mailto:spacetimebull@protonmail.com).

We are committed to enforcing this Code of Conduct for the safety, respect, and growth of our community. Together, we can create an inclusive environment for everyone to learn, share, and evolve.
