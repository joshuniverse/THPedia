**Silicon Valley** is a nickname for the southern portion of the San Francisco Bay in California. It is home to many of the largest high-tech corporations and thousands of startup companies. It is arguably the transhumanist-style life extensionist capital of the world.

## Reception
This very association has come under scrutiny due to critics who are concerned about its potential for [[Pages/oligarchic transhumanism|oligarchy]] and treating [[Pages/transhumanism as a religion|transhumanism as a religion]]:^[[Transhumanism: Zoltan Istvan vs. Professor R. Jones](http://quarterly.demos.co.uk/article/issue-8/transhumanism-zoltan-vs-professor-richard/)]

<blockquote>It’s not surprising that transhumanism is popular amongst the Californian techno-elite; the idea that technology is a wholly positive force unfolding with its own inevitable logic is one that is very comforting to those who benefit the most from the current arrangements. Transhumanism is, in effect, the state religion of [[Pages/The Californian Ideology|Californian techno-neoliberalism]], and like all state religions its purpose is to justify the power of the incumbents.<br/>&mdash; Professor [[Pages/Richard Jones|Richard Jones]]
</blockquote>

Criticism is often levied at prioritizing these new technologies over helping the poor and developing world:

<blockquote>It’s incredibly exciting and wonderful to be part of a species that dreams in a big way. But I also want to be part of a species that takes care of the poor and the dying, and I’m worried that our attention is being drawn away to a glittery future world that is fantasy and not the world we live in.</blockquote>^[[Tech titans’ latest project: Defy death](http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2015/04/04/tech-titans-latest-project-defy-death/)]

## Businesses
In addition to being the information technology center of the world, Silicon Valley is home to a great many biotechnology startups such as [[Pages/Calico|Calico]], as well as more overt life extensionist organizations such as [[Pages/SENS|SENS]].

## Commentary
On blind [[Pages/techno-optimism|techno-optimism]]:
<blockquote>"Silicon Valley will solve our problems via tech," she repeated from under the rubble, as the dueling plutocrats' Warbots ravaged the city - via Twitter.^[[Twitter, @MikeOdenthal, 2016-08-09](https://twitter.com/MikeOdenthal/status/766325607336701953)]
</blockquote>

On [[Pages/ethics|ethics]] and power:
<blockquote>“Engineers don’t do ethics courses and this is why Silicon Valley...” is a classist slur designed to reallocate social status between engineers and virtuous paragons like journalists, MBAs, legislators, health insurance executives, lawyers, and others who take ethics classes.^[[Twitter, @patio11, 2018-12-06](https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1070874040619819009?s=19)]
</blockquote>

On [[Pages/cryonics|cryonics]]:
<blockquote>What did change, thanks to the tech bubble, was the combined net worth of the Silicon Valley software engineers who are in the demographic sweet spot of the Alcor business model. Here were young people possessed of the lust for eternal life, who required no PR blitzes to persuade them of technology’s ability to overcome the brute empirical facts of the human condition—many with the outsize ego to cast themselves as Christlike figures awaiting resurrection and the ample self-confidence to ignore all naysayers.^[[Everybody Freeze!](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/everybody-freeze-pein)]
