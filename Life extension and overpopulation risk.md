The subject of **life extension** will often bring up questions around **overpopulation** and the idea that such **risks** may go hand in hand in leading to some kind of [[Pages/dystopia|dystopian]] future.

## Risk Advocacy
Bioethicist [[Pages/Leon Kass|Leon Kass]] is especially critical of such technologies, arguing life extension is [[Pages/deathism|unnatural]] and therefore undesirable.^[[Death as an unnatural process](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1369280/)]^[[The role of aging in society](http://www.iescience.org/?p=170)] David Attenborough has referred to humans as a 'plague on the earth' due to their environmental impact.^[[David Attenborough - Humans are plague on Earth](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/9815862/Humans-are-plague-on-Earth-Attenborough.html)] Some have advocated that overpopulation leads to warfare, but this hypothesis has been discredited.^[Overpopulation and Warfare](https://web.archive.org/web/20160603173842/http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=281&Itemid=1)

Some transhumanists are concerned about the risks of overpopulation, such as when [[Pages/Zoltan Istvan|Zoltan Istvan]] wrote "It's time to consider restricting human breeding."^[[It's time to consider restricting human breeding](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-08/14/time-to-restrict-human-breeding)]

Some [[Pages/dark green|dark green]] environmentalists believe that a growing population is too high a risk for the environment.^[[Why overpopulation is a bigger threat than global warming](http://churchandstate.org.uk/2012/11/why-overpopulation-is-bigger-threat-than-global-warming/)]

Many are concerned about the birth rates among the religious; however, this tends to be more strongly correlated with education and other factors rather than religious beliefs.^[[Hans Rosling: Religions and babies](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_religions_and_babies)]

## Risk Skepticism
![[450px-Population.jpg]]
*Report shows the slowing in population growth with UN projections*

Many life extensionists question such a risk from a variety of positions.^[[Dying doesn’t really affect overpopulation](http://www.martinborchjensen.com/hypotheses/overpopulation/)]^[[Demographic anxiety and transhumanist perspective](https://pirate.london/2015/09/demographic-anxiety-and-transhumanist-perspective/)] A 2010 paper by [[Pages/Leonid A. Gavrilov|Leonid A. Gavrilov]] from the [[Pages/Center on Aging|Center on Aging]] outlined a number of different life extension interventionist scenarios, none of which is projected to cause such a problem.^[[Demographic Consequences of Defeating Aging](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20426616)]

Life extension aside, many people are convinced we are headed for a global population crisis; however, demographic experts believe the population is due to peak at 10 billion and then decrease according to all existing projections.^[[Global population growth, box by box](http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_on_global_population_growth?language=en)]^[[Demographic Consequences of Defeating Aging](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3192186/)]

The attached report via the UN shows how population growth is in decline.^[[World Population Growth](http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/world-population-growth/)]^[[Global population growth peaked more than half a century ago in 1963 with a growth of 2.22%](https://twitter.com/MaxCRoser/status/701729665849946116)]

The [[Pages/Life Extension Advocacy Foundation|Life Extension Advocacy Foundation]] maintains dedicated resources explaining how an aging population is more problematic than overpopulation.^[[Overpopulation](http://www.lifeextensionadvocacyfoundation.org/education/overpopulation/)]

## Mitigations
Technologies such as [[Pages/mind uploading|mind uploading]] may hold the potential for limiting resource consumption even under the most extreme scenarios.

According to the Guttmacher Institute, worldwide, 40% of all pregnancies are unplanned or unwanted.^[[New Study Finds 40% Pregnancies Worldwide Are Unintended](https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2014/new-study-finds-40-pregnancies-worldwide-are-unintended)] The population crisis could be significantly dampened by simply expanding global access to contraception and by social advocacy promoting the use of contraception.

## Deconstructing Overpopulation
When faced with statistics and projections, many people still have concerns nonetheless. These can break down into ideas such as:^[[Deconstructing Overpopulation for Life Extensionists](https://pirate.london/2017/01/deconstructing-overpopulation-for-life-extensionists/)]
* General environmental sustainability - The increasing damage to the environment is caused by mankind; therefore, 'overpopulation' can be a proxy for 'concerns for environmental sustainability.'
* [[Pages/Dysgenics|Dysgenics]] - As archetypally portrayed in *Idiocracy*,^[[Idiocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy)] there exist in society certain perverse incentives to reproduce, such as financial and housing benefits which need to be addressed as part of a general population strategy, as anyone who's watched daytime talk shows may be aware.
* Penalization of the childless - For people who choose not to have children for various reasons, they are forced to support those who do, which is another unsolved problem of the current welfare state.
* We are currently over capacity^[[Carrying capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrying_capacity)] - Some environmental groups argue mankind has already exceeded its carrying capacity and a significant ''reduction'' is required.
* Localized instability - Factors like immigration into small towns are increasingly politicized where local services are improperly funded to handle the consequences of this.
* Aging population - The population is getting older, less able to work, and more reliant on social security institutions. This is a great argument for increasing [[Pages/healthspan|healthspan]], not just lifespan!^[[Scientists More Worried Than Public About World’s Growing Population](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/08/scientists-more-worried-than-public-about-worlds-growing-population/)]

## In Fiction
* *[[Pages/Soylent Green|Soylent Green]]*, while not featuring [[Pages/life extension|life extension]], features [[Pages/oligarchic transhumanism|inequality]], pollution, and overpopulation in a classic dystopian future scenario.^[[Wikipedia: Soylent Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soylent_Green)]
* *[[Pages/Inferno|Inferno]]* features a nominally transhumanist villain who believes in the myth of human overpopulation to the point he believes the population is due to reach 32 billion.^[[“Inferno” and the Overpopulation Myth – Article by Jonathan Newman](http://www.rationalargumentator.com/index/blog/2016/11/inferno-overpopulation-myth/)]
