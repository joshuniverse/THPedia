> "Cybernetics as a concept in society has been around at least since Plato used it to refer to government. In modern times, the term became widespread because [Norbert Wiener](https://hpluspedia.org/index.php?title=Norbert_Wiener&action=edit&redlink=1 "Norbert Wiener (page does not exist)") wrote a book called “Cybernetics” in 1948. His sub-title was “control and communication in the animal and machine”. This was important because it connects control (actions taken in hope of achieving goals) with communication (connection and information flow between the actor and the environment). So, Wiener is pointing out that effective action requires communication. Later, Gordon Pask offered conversation as the core interaction of systems that have goals.
